**7th-level transmutation (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a model boat and the feather of a seagull)

**Duration**: 12 hours

One boat you touch that is no more than 100 feet long gains the ability to fly. You can control the vesselâ€™s altitude up, and can cause it to rise to no more than 500 feet in the air. The vessel is still dependant on the winds to move forward, however.

When the spell ends, the ship gently lowers itself to ground or sea level.
