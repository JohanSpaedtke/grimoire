**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an amber rod)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

An explosion of lightning and crash of thunder erupts for a point you choose within range. All creatures within 20 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 1d6 lightning damage and 1d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute on a failed saving throw, or takes half as much damage and is deafened for 1 round on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 lightning and 1d6 thunder damage for each slot level above 2nd.
