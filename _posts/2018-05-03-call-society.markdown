**2st-level illusion**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 1 mile

**Components**: V, S, M (a badge, letter, or other symbol of membership, which is not consumed but must be on your person while casting this spell)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You point in a direction and cast this spell to alert other members of an organization you belong to, such as a Magesâ€™ Guild, that you require aid. The spell will travel in that direction. If it passes within 1 mile of a fellow member of your organization, it will divert to meet that creature and alert him or her as to your plight, giving that person a rough estimate of your location and a brief image of your situation. If it hits the end of its range without locating a fellow member, the spell will dissipate.

This spell does not compel the recipient to aid you, but members of your organization are likely to be willing to help.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases by one mild for every two slot levels above the 2nd.
