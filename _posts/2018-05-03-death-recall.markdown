**2st-level divination (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 round

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a fragment from a shattered mirror)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a corpse and go into a trance, wherein you relive the final ten minutes of the subjectâ€™s life, seeing it from its own perspective. You must remain in physical contact with the corpse the entire time. If you are interrupted at any point during this spell, it ends and you cannot cast it again on that corpse.
