**2nd-level transmutation (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a tiny golden needle and golden thread worth at least 5 gp that is consumed in the casting, and a strip of fine cloth twisted into a MoÌˆbius strip)

**Duration**: 1 day

You touch a pocket that has been sewn into an existing garment, no larger than 0.5 feet in diameter, and turn it into an extradimensionally large container. It can hold up to 100 pounds of objects, not exceeding a volume of 6 cubic feet. The objects must fit into the mouth of the pocket.

When the spell ends or if the pocket is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the pocket must be put right before it can be used again.

Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

Placing the pocket inside inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you double the duration of the spell but you also quadruple the cost of casting it.

If you cast it using a 7:th level spell slot and spend at least 5000 gold the spell becomes permanent.
