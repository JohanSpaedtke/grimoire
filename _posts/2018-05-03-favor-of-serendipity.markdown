Granted by gods of luck and travel, you cast this spell and one unexpected event occurs in your favor. This spell only functions when you are in a dangerous or taxing conditions. For instance, you might find shelter during a storm, stumble across the rare herb needed to cure an ally of poison, find a source of fresh, clean water in the desert, or have a chance rockslide cut of the horde of orcs thatâ€™s chasing you.

You are not in control of the chance event and if your god feels that you are abusing this spell, it may refuse to answer your prayer or cause you to suffer from a dangerous consequence instead.
