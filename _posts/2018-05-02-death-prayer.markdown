**Abjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 10 days

You pray over a corpse, reducing the likelihood that it will rise as an undead. If the creature was doomed to rise as undead due to the way it was killed (such as being drained by a vampire), or someone casts a spell such as animate dead on the corpse, it will only have a 50% chance of success. This spell provides protection once before dissipating.
