**2nd-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (the skull of a humanoid)

**Duration**: 1 day

You cast this spell while holding a humanoidâ€™s skull, then let go. The skull continues to float in mid-air, facing the same direction you had originally pointed. The skull has truesight out to 90 feet and is blind beyond that. If any creature enters its field of vision within 90 feet, it releases a piercing shriek that can be heard up to a quarter-mile away; at the same time, you are telepathically alerted.

Once placed, the skull does not move and cannot see behind it, so it can be sneaked up upon and moved from behind.

If you have multiple _skull watches_, you cannot tell which one has been triggered simply through the mental alert.
