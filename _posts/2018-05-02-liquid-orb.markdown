**Conjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You create a pint of any nonflammable, nonacidic liquid you wish â€” water, juice, dye, ink, mediocre beer, chicken broth, etc. It appears as a sphere and remains that way through magical surface tension. The liquid can be anywhere within 10 degrees of room temperature but cannot be above boiling or below freezing.

The amount of liquid you create increases to 1 quart when you reach 5th level, 1 gallon when you reach 11th level, and 10 gallons when you reach 17th level.
