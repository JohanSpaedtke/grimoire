**Necromancy cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (two golden needles)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You touch two creatures and draw blood out from one (the “donor”), channel it through yourself, and infuse it into the other (the “recipient”). This causes the donor to lose hit points equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier and the recipient to gain that number of hit points. The donor does not need to be willing and may make a Dexterity saving throw to evade your grasp. This spell has no effect on undead, con- structs, plants, and other creatures that lack blood.
