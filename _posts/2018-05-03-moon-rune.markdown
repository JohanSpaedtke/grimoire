You write up to seven nonmagical runes on any surface. This mark remains invisible until conditions you specify during the casting of this spell. The condition can be anything: a specific time of day or year, when moonlight (or light from a certain phase of the moon) illuminates the runes, or when the surface is touched by a member race, sex, or class, and so on.
