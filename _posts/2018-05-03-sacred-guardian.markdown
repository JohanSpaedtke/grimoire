**1st-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a rose petal)

**Duration**: 24 hours

You touch a willing creature. For the spellâ€™s duration, if that creature is ever in danger, you are mentally warned and given a mental image of the situation. This works no matter how far away that creature is, but will not inform you of its location.
