**2nd-level enchantment**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against the truth in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak the truth while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it doesn’t want to lie. Such a creature can hint at the truth as long as the bulk of its statement is a lie.
