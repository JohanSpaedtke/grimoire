**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10-feet radius)

**Components**: V, M (a pint of vinegar)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

While this spell is active, any words you or anyone within ten feet of you magically appear on a blank piece of paper in the language in which they were spoken. Spells with verbal components that are cast during that time cannot be recorded; the spell will continue but simply skip the time when the spell was cast or record a row of asterisks. Command words for magical items, however, can be recorded.
