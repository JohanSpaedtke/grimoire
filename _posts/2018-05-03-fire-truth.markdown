**1st-level divination (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 5 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a candle made of pure beeâ€™s wax that is worth 25 gp, which is consumed by the spell)

**Duration**: 1 minute

You light a specially-made candle and place it within 5 feet of a named target. If the target then knowingly tells a lie, the candle flares brightly. A half-lie or slight deception causes the candle to gutter and flicker. If the target tells an outrageous lie, the candle extinguishes itself.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 5th-level or higher spell slot, and the target tells a lie, the fire leaps and burns the target, inflicting 1d8 fire damage with each lie.
