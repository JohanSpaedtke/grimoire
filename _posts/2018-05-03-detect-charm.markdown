**2st-level divination**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (the crushed petals of a bleeding-heart flower)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You look into the eyes of a target and can see if that creature is under a magical charm or under any similar spell (a spell that does not function if the target is immune to charm, such as suggestion). This spell does not reveal what sort of charm the target is under or who placed the charm on that person. You can examine one person per round.
