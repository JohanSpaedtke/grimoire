**2nd-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (roughly-ground glass, which must be sprinkled in a circle around the recipient)

**Duration**: 1 hour

You provide protection for yourself or one willing creature against unwanted mental intrusion. Any effect that would sense the protected creature’s emotions or read its thoughts or put the charmed condition on it will trigger the trap. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw. The attacker takes 3d10 psychic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once this spell has been triggered, it ends.
