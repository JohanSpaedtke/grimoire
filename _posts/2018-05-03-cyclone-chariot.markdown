**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You call forth a whirlwind of great strength, which forms beneath your feet in the shape of a chariot. It is capable of carrying you and up to eight other creatures of your choice and can fly at a speed of 120 feet as high as 20 feet above the ground. You control the chariotâ€™s horizontal and vertical movements mentally. You can cross rivers, chasms, and so forth, floating level with the last solid surface it touched until reaching solid ground again, at which point you can alter its altitude.

Any nonmagical missile lighter than a boulder aimed at the chariot is blown aside. Melee attacks aimed in or out of the chariot are ad disadvantage; melee attacks from one rider to another are unaffected. The chariot itself is immune to physical attack.

The chariot can be used as a weapon by ramming it into a target. Each creature of Large size or smaller that is outside of the chariot and that touches the chariot must make a Strength saving throw at disad- vantage. On a failure, the creature takes 8d10 bludgeoning damage and is flung in a random direction and knocked prone. If the tar- get hit a solid object, such as a wall or floor, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.
