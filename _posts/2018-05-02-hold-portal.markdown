You magically hold a door, gate, or hatch shut, as if it had been closed tightly and locked or barred. Strength ability checks to bash the door down are at disadvantage, but this spell is instantly countered by knock.

Optionally, this spell can be used to hold a door, gate, or hatch open. Strength checks to force it closed are at a disadvantage.
