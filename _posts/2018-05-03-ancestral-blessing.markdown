You call upon your ancestor spirits for advice or protection. You may ask it to complete one task for you:

 - Oracle. You ask the spirit a question, which it answers to the best of its ability. It will not lie to you, but it may not know the answer.
 - Blessing. The spirit blesses you. For the next 24 hours, you have advantage on one saving throw of your choice.
 - Guardianship. The spirit will guard your home or workspace. It will alert you instantly if there are any intruders, no matter where you are (as long as you are on the same plane), but it cannot fight or otherwise interfere.
