**1st-level abjuration (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (an item of jewelry that costs 50 gp per level of the spell it is designed to protect against)

**Duration**: Special

You enchant an amulet with the ability to protect the wearer from a specific spell that you know how to cast and that allows for a saving throw.

When the wearer is attacked by that spell and fails the saving throw, the amulet absorbs the magic and shatters, protecting the wearer.
