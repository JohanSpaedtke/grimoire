**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10-foot cube)

You create a physical effect of a visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile na- ture in a 10-foot cube. This effect can take nearly any form but cannot be harmful or debilitating. For instance, you can create haunting music that plays on repeat or when a creature enters the area, the scent of pine trees or lemons in a room, make the floor or walls feel spongy, or so on.
