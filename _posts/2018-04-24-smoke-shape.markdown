You may shape masses of smoke, mist, or fog into any shape you want, although you will be incapable of fine detail.

Once you have created the desired shape, you may give it a gentle push or blow hard on it, propelling it in one direction with a speed of 30 feet.

You can only affect a cloud of smoke up to Large sized.

A strong wind will rapidly dissipate the shape.
