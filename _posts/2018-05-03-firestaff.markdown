**2nd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of phosphorous and a pinch of iron filings)

**Duration**: 1 minute

The ends of a wooden staff that you are holding burst into blue-white flame. You may use the staff itself or hand it to someone else to use. When the staff hits a target, it does an additional 2d6 fire damage.

The flames on the staff cannot be extinguished by any means. It can be used to set combustibles on fire, but the fires it sets are normal and can be extinguished normally.
