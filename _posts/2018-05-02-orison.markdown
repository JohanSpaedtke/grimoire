The most basic prayers that an acolyte learns, orisons are used to hone the spellcasting ability of priests. You create one of the following effects within range.

 - You cause mundane pain and nausea to lessen for up to 1 hour, or heal one crea- ture other than yourself of 1d4 hit points of damage.
 - You bless a meal (food to be shared by up to four individuals), and roll a d4. Add that number to any saving throw to avoid being poisoned by that meal or drink.
 - One candle cannot be extinguished by any means for as long as you hold it.
 - You offer up a quick prayer along the lines of “give me strength!” or “don’t let me fail!” The GM secretly rolls 2d20 and records the better of the two rolls. At some point during the next hour, you may choose to replace your roll with that roll, for good or for ill.
