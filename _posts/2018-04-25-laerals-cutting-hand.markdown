**1st-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute

One of your hands gains a magical cut- ting edge. The merest touch of your hand will sever nonmagical ropes, sacks, and the like. Unarmed strikes do 1d6 + your Strength modifier in slashing damage.
