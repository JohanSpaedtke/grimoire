A flame springs forth from your palm. The flame can be either red or white, and you may switch between them as a bonus action.

 - _Red Flame._ Hot but not particularly bright, you can use this flame to ignite flammable materials, cook food, or to scorch beings you touch, doing 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier in fire damage.

 - _White Flame._ Bright but cool, the white flame cannot set anything on fire and does no damage, but it sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
