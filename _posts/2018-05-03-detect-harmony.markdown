**1st-level divination (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 round

**Range**: Self (60-foot radius sphere)

**Components**: V, S, M (a scroll on which prayers have been written in exotic inks worth at least 10 gp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You gain understanding of the balance of good, evil, law, and chaos in the immediate area. The answers are vague (“there is more evil than good here” or “there is much randomness and chaos here”) and do not reveal the exact nature or cause of the imbalance.
