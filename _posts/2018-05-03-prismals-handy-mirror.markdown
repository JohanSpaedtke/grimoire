**2nd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a shard of glass)

**Duration**: 1 hour

You create a floating mirror that is 4 square feet; you may pick its length and height. When you cast this spell, and on each subsequent turn, you can use a bonus action to move the mirror up to 60 feet or to angle or turn it.

The mirror is an object that has AC 12 and 10 hit points. If broken, razor-sharp shards explode outward and all creatures within 20 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 piercing damage on a failed saving throw or half as much on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the mirror can be another square foot each slot level above 2nd.
