One willing creature you touch gains a pair of wings. The creature’s flying speed is double your walking speed, and the creature gains one additional ability, depending on the type of wing:

 * _Butterfly Wings._ These wings grant the bearer the ability to flutter — the bearer moves in an erratic fashion. While in the air, any creature targeting the bearer with a melee or missile weapon attack are at disadvantage to do so.
 * _Dragon Wings._ These wings grant the bearer a wing buffet attack, which can be used as a bonus action. This attack has a reach of 10 feet and inflicts 1d4 + the bearer’s Strength modifier, and that creature must make a Strength saving throw, with a DC equal to 8 + the bearer’s Strength modifier, or fall prone.
 * _Dragonfly Wings._ These wings grant the bearer the ability to hover.
 * _Eagle Wings._ These wings grant the bearer the ability to make a dive attack. If you dive at least 30 feet straight towards a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack, the attack deals an additional 1d10 damage to the target.
