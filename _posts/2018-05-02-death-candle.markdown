**1st-level divination (ritual)**

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Special

**Components**: V, S, M (a candle)

**Duration**: Special

You give a willing creature; while casting this spell, that creature must light the candle.

From then on, the candle will burn continuously without using any fuel for as long as the creature who lit it is alive. If that creature is ever near death or contracts a fatal illness, the candle will gutter and dim, but it will only go out when that creature dies. The candle cannot be extinguished except by magical means. If the creature dies and is brought back to life, it does not reignite the candle.
